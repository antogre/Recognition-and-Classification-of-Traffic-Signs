# Recognition-and-Classification-of-Traffic-Signs
This project focuses on the recognition and classification of traffic signs using state-of-the-art object detection models. The goal is to build and evaluate machine learning solutions that can identify traffic signs and assess their condition (worn-out vs. good).
